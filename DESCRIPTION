Description: Distance-correlation based Gene Set Analysis for
        longitudinal gene expression profiles. In longitudinal studies,
        the gene expression profiles were collected at each visit from
        each subject and hence there are multiple measurements of the
        gene expression profiles for each subject. The dcGSA package
        could be used to assess the associations between gene sets and
        clinical outcomes of interest by fully taking advantage of the
        longitudinal nature of both the gene expression profiles and
        clinical outcomes.
